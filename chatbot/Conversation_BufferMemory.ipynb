      "We cut our GPM forecast for 2024 by 78bps to 41.7%; however, we expect VNM’s GPM to continue the uptrend in the medium term. We forecast VNM’s 2024 gross profit margin of 41.7%, which is equivalent to a 100bps YoY increase, in line with management’s expectations as VNM has secured the input milk cost for production up to end of H1 2024. Nevertheless, we keep our 2024F-28F aggregate gross profit unchanged as we expect a gradual shift in VNM's sales mix towards higher-margin categories (i.e., liquid milk and infant formula) following an increase in marketing investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We project the SG&A expenses to increase 7% YoY in 2024 as we see management’s determination in spending more on marketing activities to regain market share. We cut our OPM forecast for 2024 by 116bps to 17%. According to management, the rebranding campaign in H2 2023 showed initial result with a 2.8-ppt increase in market share for the liquid milk, equivalent to ~56% market share by YE 2023. In 2024, we expect that in 2024, SG&A expense will grow by 7% YoY as part of VNM’s strategy to continue increasing market share in the liquid milk and regain share in the infant formula milk segment. In the latest analyst meeting in February 2024, VMN said that the company will engage third-party consultants to (1) revamp marketing activities of the segment and (2) restructure distribution channels towards higher exposure to modern channels. VNM expects new packaging for its infant formula in H1 2024. In the medium term, we expect OPM to maintain its uptrend momentum, improve from 16.2% in 2023 to 19.1% in 2028F as we expect the deceleration on marketing spending during 2025-28F, with the selling expense/revenue decreasing from 21.7% in 2024F to 21.2% on average during 2025-28F.\n",
